This project utilizes an IR sensor and a seven-segment display to count objects passing through a detection field, incrementing the count from 0 to 9. The system is built using an Arduino Uno, push buttons, and LEDs. A reset button is included to reset the count.

Key features:
IR Sensor Integration: Detects objects and increments the display count.
Real-Time Counting: Displays the count dynamically on a seven-segment display.
Reset Functionality: Resets the count to zero at any time.
Practical Applications: Useful for monitoring production lines, vehicle flow, and more.
The project demonstrates the integration of sensors, displays, and Arduino programming for a simple yet effective counting system.
